    "text": "Abstract\nThis case study explores patterns in activity, sleep, and energy expenditure using Fitbit smart-device data to guide marketing strategies for Bellabeat, a wellness company. Using R for cleaning, analysis, and visualization, I examined relationships between steps, calories, and sleep, as well as temporal patterns by weekday and hour. Results suggest that higher activity correlates strongly with calorie burn, 7–8 hours of sleep align with improved next-day activity, and evenings/weekends present opportunities for targeted engagement. These findings inform data-driven recommendations such as sleep reminders, evening workout nudges, and segmented user messaging."
