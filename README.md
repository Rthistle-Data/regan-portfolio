## 📊 Featured Project: Bellabeat Capstone Case Study
Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of wellness products, wanted to better understand how consumers use their smart devices.  
For this project, I analyzed Fitbit data (daily activity, sleep, and hourly steps) and generated insights to inform Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

### Key Insights
- **Steps & Activity → Calories:** Very active minutes and total steps strongly predict calorie burn.  
- **Sleep → Performance:** 7–8 hours of sleep align with higher next-day activity.  
- **Time Patterns:** Evening and weekend activity patterns highlight key engagement windows.  
- **User Segments:** Distinct step-based segments suggest targeted messaging opportunities.  

### Recommendations
1. Sleep reminders and smart alarms to improve sleep quality.  
2. Evening “micro-workout” nudges to boost activity.  
3. Weekend streak challenges with gamification.  
4. Segment-specific campaigns (low-step vs. high-step users).
